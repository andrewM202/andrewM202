### Hey there! 

I am a 19 year old software engineer looking to make an impact and engage in an interesting work environment. I have interests in all facets of computer science - I have dabbled in **blockchain technology** (with the Solidity language), to **graphics engines** (C++ and OpenGL), to **machine learning** (Python, Pytorch), to having fun making small **networking** projects (Python Sockets). I have a solid understanding of the full web stack, from back end to front end, and made, deployed, or worked on a variety of websites in a variety of languages - Laravel, Flask, Asp.net. 

In the near future, I am hoping to release a couple big projects that I am hoping will catch some eyes - watch out!

Languages:
- HTML
- CSS 
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Bootstrap CSS
- JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - Svelte.js
  - React.js
- Python
  - Flask
  - Pytorch
  - And many more python libraries
- PHP
  - Laravel
- SQL (MSSQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL)
- MongoDB
- Solidity
- C++
  - OpenGL
  
Technologies and Deployment Tools:
- NPM
- Git
- Jira, Zendesk
- Rollup
- Webpack
- Nginx Web Server
- Heroku
